Dynamic Honeytoken Generator for Threat Detection
1. Problem Statement
Cyberattacks, including phishing, malware, viruses, and insider threats, are increasingly complex and damaging. A tool that generates dynamic honeytokens can help organizations proactively detect a variety of attacks by triggering alerts when these tokens are accessed, leading to faster incident response.

2. Expanded Features and Implementation
Dynamic Honeytoken Creation
Credentials Generator:
Generate fake usernames, passwords, API keys, and email logins that mimic real user accounts, making it harder for attackers to distinguish between real and fake credentials.
Fake Documents with Tracking Links:
Embed tracking links or fake credentials within documents such as PDFs, Word docs, or Excel files. These links should point to AWS S3 pre-signed URLs or Firebase dynamic links to track access.
Fake Malware or Virus Files:
Generate fake files with dummy malware or virus signatures that are tracked when accessed. For instance, these could appear like executable files (.exe) or compressed archives (.zip), which, when opened, trigger alerts.
Real-Time Alerts
Immediate Alert Notifications:
Alerts should be sent in real time when honeytokens are accessed, whether they are credentials, documents, or malware files.
Phishing: Alert when fake email credentials are used.
Virus/Malware: Alert when a fake malware file is opened or executed.
Insider Threats: Alert if an internal user accesses honeytokens in sensitive directories.
Metadata Collection:
Log key metadata such as IP address, location (using geolocation APIs like ipinfo.io), time of access, and the specific honeytoken accessed. This data helps identify the nature of the attack.
Integration with Existing Systems
Phishing Detection:
Integrate honeytokens with email systems like Gmail, Outlook, or company email servers to generate and embed fake credentials that attackers might attempt to steal.
Malware Detection:
Place fake files (e.g., viruses, trojans) in shared file directories, cloud storage (e.g., AWS S3, Google Drive), or internal networks to trigger alerts when accessed.
Integration with SIEM Systems:
Allow for integration with Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems (e.g., Splunk, Elasticsearch) for centralized monitoring and alerting.
Customizable Tokens
AI-Powered Mimicry:
Use machine learning to generate honeytokens that mimic the real infrastructure of the organization (e.g., API keys, server credentials) or simulate realistic malware behavior.
Tailored Templates:
Let organizations create honeytokens specific to their environment, such as fake API keys for different services (AWS, Google Cloud) or fake malware that simulates attacks specific to the organization’s software.
Dashboard for Monitoring
Real-Time Visualization:
Develop a dashboard using React.js or Vue.js that displays live logs of honeytoken access attempts. The dashboard should be able to visualize attack trends, types of attacks (phishing, malware, etc.), and potential threat actors.
Analysis of Attack Patterns:
Provide analytics on where and when attacks are most likely to occur, identifying patterns across different honeytokens to help predict future attack methods.
Additional Features
Network Monitoring:
Add network monitoring features that track the source of malicious activities when a honeytoken is accessed, helping to correlate these activities with other network behaviors.
Cross-Platform Coverage:
Ensure honeytokens are generated and monitored across various platforms such as local file systems, cloud storage (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure), and communication platforms (email, Slack, etc.).
